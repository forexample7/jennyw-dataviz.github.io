                    <p>The Great Smoky Mountains National Park stands out with the largest block, indicating it had the highest visitation in 2023. Its central location and accessibility likely contribute to its popularity. </p>
                    <h3>&#x1F929; Western Region Dominates</h3>
                    <p>Parks in the western region, such as Grand Canyon, Zion, Yellowstone, and Rocky Mountain, occupy significant space in the treemap, showing their high visitation numbers. This indicates that the western region remains a hotspot for park tourism.</p>

                    <h3>&#x1F929; Great Smoky Mountain Champions the Visitation for 20 years</h3>
                    <p>Not only in 2023, the Great Smoky Mountain has been the top 1 most popular park in the US for the past 20 years. It’s worth noting that visitation patterns may also be influenced by the size of the parks. Larger parks might attract more visitors due to their capacity to offer diverse attractions and accommodate large crowds. This could partially explain why some parks consistently rank among the top visited, despite fluctuations in overall visitation trends. </p>
                    <h3>&#x1F929; Covid and Post-covid Activities</h3>
                    <p>Before 2019, visitation trends were relatively stable, with a steady, linear growth in the number of visitors. However, starting in 2019, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a sharp decline in visitation across all parks along with significant ranking changes. It might be because that different areas of the country were affected by the covid sooner or later, which affected people’s decision of going out and self quarantine at home. By mid-2020, visitation numbers began to recover, and ranking shifts still happened and much slowed</p>

                    <p>The map demonstrates the geographical distribution of all the national parks in the United States and their level of biodiversity. Each circle represents a national park, color indicates different states and the size of the circle represents the number of species within that park. </p>

                    <h3>&#x1F929; Western US Dominance</h3>
                    <p>Many of the largest circles, representing parks with high biodiversity, are concentrated in the western United States (e.g., California, Arizona, and Utah). This suggests that western parks, often larger and more ecologically diverse, host a greater number of species. </p>
                    <h3>&#x1F929; State Biodiversity Champions - California, Hawaii</h3>
                    <p>Multiple parks in California show relatively large circles, indicating high biodiversity. Parks like Yosemite, Sequoia, and Redwood likely contribute significantly to the state’s ecological richness. </p>
                    <p>The parks in Hawaii, though geographically isolated, show moderately sized circles. This indicates that while isolated ecosystems in Hawaii host unique species, their total numbers may be more limited compared to larger mainland parks. </p>

The visualization divides the parks into regions (e.g., Pacific West, Intermountain, Southeast, Alaska, etc.), with each region further broken down into individual parks. The chart provides a hierarchical view, starting from the broader regional level at the inner circle and moving outward to specific parks. The sunburst chart complements the map view by offering organizational and hierarchical insights that the map alone cannot provide.

These parks boast diverse ecosystems, ranging from towering redwoods to arid deserts, making California a standout for both biodiversity and tourism.</p>

                    <p>Tennessee may have fewer parks, but the Great Smoky Mountains National Park outshines with its status as the most visited park in the U.S. and a biodiversity hotspot, cementing Tennessee’s importance in the national park system.</p>

                    <p>Many of the largest circles, representing parks with high biodiversity, are concentrated in the western United States (e.g., California, Arizona, and Utah). This suggests that western parks, often larger and more ecologically diverse, host a greater number of species. </p>
                    <p>Southeast Region has parks like the Great Smoky Mountains, which consistently rank high in categories like vascular plants, emphasizing their biodiversity significance.</p>
                    <p>Intermountain Region, featuring parks such as Grand Canyon and Yellowstone, showcases strong rankings for mammals and reptiles, highlighting its unique arid and mountainous ecosystems.</p>
                   
                    <h3>&#x1F929; Birds</h3>
                    <p>Death Valley and Redwood are ranked first and second in bird species diversity, suggesting their importance as avian habitats. This is noteworthy given their contrasting ecosystems: desert in Death Valley and dense forests in Redwood. </p>
                    
                    <h3>&#x1F929; Mammals</h3>
                    <p>Death Valley again leads in mammal species, emphasizing its ability to support a surprisingly rich diversity of life despite its harsh environment. Other notable parks include Yellowstone and Great Basin.</p>

                    <h3>&#x1F929; Vascular Plants</h3>
                    <p>The Great Smoky Mountains dominate this category, showcasing their dense and varied flora. Redwood also ranks highly, reflecting the significance of its towering forest ecosystems.</p>

                    <h3>&#x1F929; Reptiles</h3>
                    <p>Parks like Grand Canyon and Saguaro excel in this category, likely due to their hot, arid climates that support reptilian species.</p>
