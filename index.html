                    Welcome to our exploration of U.S. national parks, where we dive into their two core dimensions: visitation and biodiversity. Through interactive visualizations, this project showcases how millions of visitors engage with these parks each year and highlights the incredible diversity of species they protect. Whether you’re curious about the most visited parks or the species that make each park unique, this website offers a detailed look into the numbers and trends that define these treasured landscapes.

                    National parks in the United States serve as both popular tourist destinations and critical conservation areas. These parks span diverse ecosystems—from arid deserts and lush forests to expansive wetlands and remote islands—each harboring unique species. To examine biodiversity, this project relies on the <a href="https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/">NPSpecies database</a>, a comprehensive resource documenting species occurrences across the National Park Service system. By combining this biodiversity data with visitation metrics, the project offers an insightful look into the individual and regional characteristics of U.S. national parks, celebrating their dual roles in recreation and preservation.

                    <h2>Overview Map: Regions, National Parks, and Visitation</h2>
                    <p>The National Park System is a treasure of the United States, and for a good reason. Spanning vast landscapes and unique ecosystems, these parks are a testament to the country’s geo and bio scene. The location of national parks can be divided into six regions: Alaska, Pacific West, Intermountain, Midwest, Southeast, and Northwest. Take a look at the map to see which states fall in which regions, and the distribution of the national parks (indicated by the tree icons) across the country. Using color, the tree icons also represent visitation levels across various national parks within each region. The darker green trees signify higher visitation numbers, while the lighter green trees indicate lower visitation. </p>
                    <p>There are more national parks in the western part of the country, as the tree icons are much more dense on the left of the map. Specifically, California and Utah are the leading states to host the most national parks. There is also a great variety of visitation across parks in Utah, so some of them are more popular than others. Which national parks exactly? Can you recognize any of the national park names?

                    <p>The Great Smoky Mountains National Park stands out with the darkest glyph and the largest block, indicating it had the highest visitation in 2023. The popularity of this park stands out so drastically from the rest of the park that we indicated it with a standalone darker green – its central location and accessibility likely contribute to its popularity. </p>

                    <p>Parks in the western region, such as the Grand Canyon, Zion, Yellowstone, and Rocky Mountain, occupy significant space in the treemap, showing their high visitation numbers. This indicates that the western region remains a hotspot for park tourism. The Alaska Region occupies only a small area of the treemap, and despite having multiple national parks in that region, all of them have low visitation, as the region is definitely a unique hidden gem. </p>

                    <h3>&#x1F929; Great Smoky Mountain Champions the Visitation for 20 years</h3>
                    <p>Not only in 2023, the Great Smoky Mountain has been the top 1 most popular park in the US for the past 20 years. It’s worth noting that visitation patterns may also be influenced by the size of the parks. Larger parks might attract more visitors due to their capacity to offer diverse attractions and accommodate large crowds. This could partially explain why some parks consistently rank among the top visited, despite fluctuations in overall visitation trends. </p>
                    <h3>&#x1F4A5; COVID and Post-COVID Activities</h3>
                    <p>Before 2019, visitation trends were relatively stable, with a steady, linear growth in the number of visitors. However, starting in 2019, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a sharp decline in visitation across all parks along with significant ranking changes. It might be because different areas of the country were affected by the pandemic sooner or later, and there were corresponding policies regarding the visitation of national parks, which affected people’s decision to go outdoors or self-quarantine at home. By mid-2020, visitation numbers began to recover (as with the rest of the activities happening across the board), while ranking shifts still happened and were much slowed. </p>

                    <p>Many of the largest circles, representing parks with high biodiversity, are concentrated in the western United States (e.g., California, Arizona, and Utah). This suggests that western parks, often larger and more ecologically diverse, host a greater number of species. </p>
                    <h3>&#x1F9EC; State Biodiversity Champions - California, Hawaii</h3>
                    <p>Multiple parks in California show relatively large circles, indicating high biodiversity. Parks like Yosemite, Sequoia, and Redwood likely contribute significantly to the state’s ecological richness. </p>
                    <p>The parks in Hawaii, though geographically isolated, show moderately sized circles. This indicates that while isolated ecosystems in Hawaii host unique species, their total numbers may be more limited compared to larger mainland parks. </p>

                    <p>On the left of this Sankey Diagram, the national parks are listed along with a number next to each park, representing the total species found in that park. On the right, different species categories are listed (e.g., birds, mammals, reptiles, fish, and amphibians) along with the total count for each category across all parks. The thickness of the connections (or flows) between the parks and species categories represents the proportion of species in that category relative to the park.

                        Birds are the most represented category across all parks, with 3,143 total species. This suggests birds are a common and diverse group in national parks. And it also suggests that birdlife is a key ecological feature.

                    <p>
                        In the overall view, we can see that birds are the most documented species across all parks, averaging around 200-300 birds. There is also a greater variance across the birds dataset, as the dots are more spread out compared to the other species.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>&#x1F3CA; Swimming Through the Ranks</h3>
                    <p>
                        Though the other species categories bundle close to the zero-end of the spectrum, it is interesting to point out that fish have a few outliers that far exceed the number of most documented birds in a state. If we hover over these two points, we can see that these parks are from American Samoa and Florida, which are areas both surrounded by water.

                            Birds are the most well-documented species by a significant margin for most parks across California. While mammals come in second place for most parks, that is not the case for the top 2 biodiverse parks (Channel Islands and Redwood) in which fish come in second. These trends closely follow what we show in a prior visualization, Species Categories in National Parks, in which birds come out as the most documented species across all national parks, while two fish data points stand out as outliers.

                        <p>
                            In regards to non-nativeness, the two national parks in Hawaii (Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and Haleakala National Park) are ranked the highest. This proves true as Hawaii experiences high levels of tourism and, according to <a href='https://www.nps.gov/havo/learn/nature/invasive-animals.htm'>NPS</a>, the influx of humans on the islands of Hawaii also brings over invasive species that threaten the population of native species, which also explains why the ratio is skewed in this way.

                            In regards to nativeness, the viz shows that the top 2 parks are both from Alaska, which makes sense as Alaska is fairly isolated in comparison to other national parks located within North America and is on the polar end of the spectrum when it comes to visitation, as shown in our visitation treemap.

                    <h3>&#x1F929; Abundance leaders - Pacific West Region, Intermountain Region</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Pacific West Region and the Intermountain Region show the highest overall species abundance, particularly for native species, with numerous “abundant” and “common” bubbles. This underscores its rich biodiversity and effective habitat support.
                    </p>

                    <h3>&#x1F929; More Native species with spread out circles</h3>
                    <p>
                        In general, the native species still dominates in all national parks and it has more spread out circles indicating a wider range of abundance statuses from “rare” to “abundant.” This suggests that native species occupy diverse ecological niches, with some species thriving in large numbers while others are less commonly observed. On the contrary, non-native species tend to cluster in the lower abundance categories, reflecting their limited establishment within the parks.
                    </p>

                    <h3>&#x1F929; Redder ends reach surprising heights</h3>
                    <p>
                        Overall, there are fewer records of the “greener” end of the spectrum (“abundant” to “uncommon”) as opposed to the “redder” end of the spectrum (“occasional” to “unknown”).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        &#x1F44B; Use the Category filter on the right to look at the category of species you are interested in. If you click on Bird, you will find there is a large variation between Native vs. Non-native species. There are much more native birds than non-native birds, and the native ones have more varied abundance levels. If you click on Amphibian, notice how two of the regions – Northeast and Midwest – don’t have any non-native amphibians recorded.

                        <p>
                            In our project, we designed data visualizations generated by datasets provided by the National Park Service (NPS) to look deeper into the dimensions of national parks, and how the variables compare, connect, and interact with one another. With each visualization, we were able to discover trends across all parks and specific insights from streamlined perspectives, as well as interesting outliers. Additionally, we invite you to interact with certain visualizations to uncover how we discovered certain insights, as well as encourage you to discover insights of your own.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a time where the rise of technology pushes us to spend more time online and indoors, we inspire you to venture outside and visit a national park! They are an invaluable resource for wildlife preservation and provide a glimpse into a protected world we should strive to protect.
